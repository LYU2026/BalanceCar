Module "Test"      (bean BitIO)
   - Test_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Test_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Test_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Cpu"       (bean MCF52255_100_LQFP)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts. This method sets the interrupt level mask group in the SR register by 
                value = 0.
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts. This method sets the interrupt level mask group in the SR register by 
                value = 7.
   - Cpu_SetIntLevel -Sets the interrupt level mask in the SR register. Interrupt requests are inhibited for all priority 
                levels less than or equal to current level, except edge-sensitive level 7 request, which cannot be masked.
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
